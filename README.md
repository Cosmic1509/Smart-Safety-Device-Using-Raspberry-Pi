<h1> Smart Safety Device Using Raspberry Pi</h1>
Although there are numerous women's safety systems on the market, a more complex system is still required to guarantee greater safety and security. Thus, in this project, an alternate way for women's security is offered, which may serve as a superior option to the rest of the available security measures via a ladies safety gadget. Here the system is designed Raspberry Pi uses GPS, GSM and IOT technology. This device provides more security and safety for women.
IOT is used for sending mail, mail consists of images along with location. GPS technology is used to track the live location of the women. Pi camera will capture the images. GSM is uses to sending the alert SMS to the predefine mobile number. Sound sensor is uses to detects the sound when she screamed. This system consists of TASER for Self-Defense.
The project was designed a Raspberry pi based women safety device. GPS, GSM, pi camera, sound sensor, LCD display, relay along with taser and panic switch is interfaced to the raspberry pi. When the women press the panic button/sound sensor detect the sound, it will send the mail and sending the alert message though GSM also activate the taser for self-defense though relay. The status of the project will display on LCD. To achieve this task raspberry pi program written in python language.

Keywords- Raspberry Pi, GSM,GPS, Self Defense, Pi camera, Taser,  Sound Sensor,   LCD display, Raspian, Python language.
